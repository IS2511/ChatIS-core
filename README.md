# ChatIS-core

This is the core of ChatIS overlay, providing JS interfaces for
stuff like messages, users, chat settings, instance status, etc.
The library tries to be as abstract as possible without loosing its purpose:
providing a versatile interface to build chat overlays on.
Abstract meaning having own facilities for messages, users, etc.
It allows the library to support different platforms (ex: regular IRC).
But not to lie, its primary focus is *Twitch*.
